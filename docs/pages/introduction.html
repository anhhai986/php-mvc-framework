<h2>MVC</h2>

Like most modern web programming frameworks, ApPHP Framework has been developed in accordance with the
MVC pattern ("Model-View-Controller"). The MVC requires that the entire software logic should be separated
into three loosely bound parts (layers):

<ul>
    <li>Data management layer (Model)</li>
    <li>View presentation layer</li>
    <li>Business logic layer (Controller) which is responsible for receiving, validating and processing
        user requests as well as for obtaining data from the model (database) and preparing them for proper
        displaying in users' browsers
    </li>
</ul>

<h4>HTTP request processing scheme</h4>    
<ol>
    <li>A user request is received for processing by the main dispatching file.</li>
    <li>Framework kernel parses the requested URL.</li>
    <li>The routing system determines which application must be requested and which action it must execute according to the URL contents.</li>
    <li>For each application action, the appropriate controller is located which handles further request processing.</li>
    <li>The controller executes business logic and requests data from the database using model classes where necessary.</li>
    <li>To generate the resulting web page, the controller consecutively calls methods of one or more action classes.</li>
    <li>The data returned by actions are passed on to the template engine to generate the resulting HTML code.</li>
    <li>The template engine generates HTML code using the received data and the specified template files.</li>
</ol>
